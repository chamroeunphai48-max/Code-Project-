      <h1>What is Karma?</h1>
      <p>Karma isn't a person but a core concept in Indian religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism) meaning "action" or "deed," referring to the universal law where your intentions and actions determine your future experiences, creating a cycle of cause and effect that shapes your life and rebirths (samsara). Good deeds lead to positive outcomes, bad deeds to negative, motivating moral living and ultimately aiming for release (moksha) from the cycle. 
          Key Aspects of Karma:
          Cause & Effect: Every action, thought, and word has consequences that return to you, either in this life or future ones.
          Intent Matters: The intention behind an action is crucial in determining its karmic weight.
          Cycle of Rebirth (Samsara): Karma drives the process of reincarnation, with actions in one life influencing the conditions of the next.
          Goal (Moksha): The ultimate spiritual goal is to achieve liberation (moksha) from this cycle by resolving all karma.
          Origin: The word comes from Sanskrit and means "action" or "work". 
          Types of Karma (Hinduism):
          Sanchita: The accumulated store of all past karma.
          Prarabdha: The portion of past karma that is ripe and being experienced in the present life.
          Agami: The karma being created in the present moment. 
          In Popular Culture:
          The term is often used more casually to mean "what goes around comes around," referring to immediate or future retribution or reward for actions.
