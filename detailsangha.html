      <h1>What is Sangha?</h1>
      <p>The term Sangha (Sanskrit for "assembly") in Buddhism refers to the community of practitioners, traditionally encompassing monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, who follow the Buddha's teachings (Dharma). While often used specifically for the monastic order (monks/nuns) who preserve and teach the Dharma, it also represents the wider community supporting each other on the spiritual path, forming one of Buddhism's "Three Jewels" alongside the Buddha and the Dharma. 
        Key Meanings of Sangha:
      The Monastic Community: This is the most common traditional meaning, referring to the ordained monks (bhikkhus) and nuns (bhikkhunis) who live by monastic rules and support the wider community.
        The Noble Sangha (Āryasaṅgha): This refers to any Buddhist who has attained a stage of enlightenment, regardless of being monastic or lay.
        The Fourfold Assembly (Catuparisā): This broader definition includes monks, nuns, laymen (upāsakas), and laywomen (upāsikās).
        Spiritual Community: In modern contexts, it also means the local group of friends and practitioners who share spiritual life, offering mutual support and guidance.
